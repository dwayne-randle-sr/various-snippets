mailing-list-archives
=====================

## Background
Lately typical search methods have not yielded the results I'm looking for.
I've also had difficulty with using some of the web based mailing list 
archives.  However, the information is there. 

## Goal
Provide a set of scripts that I can download the archives and index/search
myself providing myself a good end-user experience :-)

## Scripts
| Script       | Purpose                                         |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| get-archives | Get all archives based on the oldest URL in list |
